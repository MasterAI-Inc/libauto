# The MasterAI Device Library

Learn and use Python and A.I. to program your own autonomous vehicles! üöó üöÅ

Many MasterAI devices use this library. For example, the AutoAuto car below:

## Beginner or Advanced?

If you are a beginner, you will _first_ want to follow along through the lessons on [AutoAuto Labs](https://labs.autoauto.ai/). After you leveled-up through the beginner and intermediate lessons, you can come back here to explore this library more fully.

If you are an advanced programmer, you are welcome to dive right in! This library is already installed on your MasterAI device. Have a look at the section [Connecting to Your Device](#connecting-to-your-device) and the section [Examples](#examples), then you will be off-to-the-races! üèÉ

## Library Overview

The library is segmented into four packages:

- [auto](./auto/): The _core_ package. Contains the critical components for _every_ MasterAI device, such as the camera interface and the Machine Learning (ML) models.

- [cio](./cio/): A package whose only job is to talk to the on-board microcontroller. The name `cio` is short for "controller input/output". It is _pluggable_ and can support multiple backends.

- [cui](./cui/): A package whose only job is to run the console application on the device's LCD screen. The name `cui` is short for "console UI". It is _pluggable_ and can support multiple backends.

- [car](./car/): The `car` package contains helper functions for the AutoAuto _cars_. E.g. `car.forward()`, `car.left()`, `car.right()`, `car.reverse()`. If you look at the implementations of these helper functions, you find they use the `auto` package under the hood (pun intended).

## Connecting to Your Device

Here are the ways you can connect to your device:

- **SSH:** SSH'ing into your device is the quickest way to gain privileged access (i.e. to get `sudo` powers; remember Uncle Ben's words). You can log in to the device with the username `hacker`. You must obtain your device's default password from [AutoAuto Labs](https://labs.autoauto.ai/autopair/) (from the "My Devices" page, you can view your device's "Info for Advanced Users"). Every device has a different default system password. You are encouraged to change your device's system password (using the usual `passwd` command).

- **Jupyter:** Every device runs a Jupyter Notebook server on port 8888. You must obtain the password for Jupyter from [AutoAuto Labs](https://labs.autoauto.ai/autopair/) (from the "My Devices" page, you can view your device's "Info for Advanced Users"). Every device has a different Jupyter password. Note the Jupyter server does _not_ run as a privileged user; if you need privileged access, you must log into the device as the `hacker`.

- **AutoAuto Labs:** AutoAuto Labs offers a simple editor where you can write and run programs. It is pleasant to use, but it is only good for short and simple programs.

## Examples

### Drive your car!

**Note:** Only applicable to AutoAuto _cars_, not other devices.

```python
import car

# Each line below defaults to driving for 1 second (results in, 4 seconds total driving).
car.forward()
car.left()
car.right()
car.reverse()

# You can also specify the duration (in seconds), for example:
car.forward(2.5)
```

### Print to the Console

Many MasterAI devices are equipped with an LCD screen which runs a console application. You can print your own text to the console, example below:

```python
from auto import console

console.print("Hi, friend!")
console.print("How are you?")
```

The `car` package also has a print function which prints to `stdout` _and_ to the
console. (For those who use the `car` package, this is convenient.)

```python
import car

car.print("Hi, friend!")
car.print("How are you?")
```

### Use the camera

Capture a single frame:

```python
import car

frame = car.capture()
car.stream(frame, to_console=True, to_labs=True)
```

**Note:** The `car.capture()` and `car.stream()` functions are convenience functions. They use the `auto` package internally. E.g. The following code uses the next-layer-down interfaces to capture frames continuously.

```python
from auto.camera import global_camera
from auto.frame_streamer import stream

camera = global_camera()

for frame in camera.stream():
    # <process frame here>
    stream(frame, to_console=True, to_labs=True)
```

You can clear the frame from the console like this:

```python
import car
car.stream(None, to_console=True, to_labs=True)

# --or--

from auto.frame_streamer import stream
stream(None, to_console=True, to_labs=True)
```

### Detect faces

```python
import car

while True:
    frame = car.capture()
    car.detect_faces(frame)
    car.stream(frame, to_labs=True)
```

The lower-level class-based interface for the face detector can be found in `auto.models.FaceDetector`. The face detector uses OpenCV under the hood.

### Detect people

We call this the "pedestrian detector" in the context of an AutoAuto _car_.

```python
import car

while True:
    frame = car.capture()
    car.detect_pedestrians(frame)
    car.stream(frame, to_labs=True)
```

The lower-level class-based interface for the people detector can be found in `auto.models.PedestrianDetector`. The people detector uses OpenCV under the hood.

### Detect stop signs

```python
import car

while True:
    frame = car.capture()
    car.detect_stop_signs(frame)
    car.stream(frame, to_labs=True)
```

The lower-level class-based interface for the stop sign detector can be found in `auto.models.StopSignDetector`. The stop sign detector uses OpenCV under the hood.

### Helper functions: object location & size

The following works with the returned value from:
 - `car.detect_faces()` (shown in example below)
 - `car.detect_pedestrians()`
 - `car.detect_stop_signs()`

```python
import car

frame = car.capture()
rectangles = car.detect_faces(frame)
car.stream(frame, to_labs=True)

location = car.object_location(rectangles, frame.shape)
size = car.object_size(rectangles, frame.shape)

car.print("Object location:", location)
car.print("Object size:", size)
```

### Raw OpenCV

In the example below, we will use OpenCV to do edge-detection using the Canny edge filter.

```python
import cv2
import car

print("OpenCV version:", cv2.__version__)

while True:
    frame = car.capture(verbose=False)
    frame_gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    frame_edges = cv2.Canny(frame_gray, 100, 200)
    car.stream(frame_edges, to_labs=True, verbose=False)
```

### Classify frame's center color

```python
import car

frame = car.capture()
color = car.classify_color(frame)
car.stream(frame, to_labs=True)
car.print("The detected color is", color)
```

The lower-level class-based interface for the color classifier can be found in `auto.models.ColorClassifier`.

### Precise steering

**Note:** Only applicable to AutoAuto _cars_, not other devices.

```python
from car.motors import set_steering
import time

for angle in range(-45, 46):       # goes from -45 to +45
    set_steering(angle)
    time.sleep(0.05)

for angle in range(45, -46, -1):   # goes from +45 to -45
    set_steering(angle)
    time.sleep(0.05)

time.sleep(0.5)
set_steering(0.0)  # STRAIGHT
time.sleep(1.0)
```

**Important Note:** The call to `set_steering()` is asynchronous; that is, the function returns immediately, very likely _before_ the wheels have actually had a chance to fully turn to the desired angle! Furthermore, the call only "lasts" for 1 second, then the angle will automatically revert back to _straight_. As a result you must call `set_steering()` in a loop to keep it active. (This is a safety feature, allowing the car to revert to going straight if your program crashes or if the Pi loses communication with the microcontroller.)

### Precise throttle

**Note:** Only applicable to AutoAuto _cars_, not other devices.

**WARNING:** You can easily injure the car, yourself, or others by setting the throttle too high. Use this interface with extreme caution. These cars are VERY powerful and very fast.

```python
from car.motors import set_throttle
import time

set_throttle(0.0)     # CAR IN NEUTRAL
time.sleep(1.0)

set_throttle(20.0)   # 1/5 THROTTLE  (100 is max, don't try that though)
time.sleep(1.0)

set_throttle(50.0)    # HALF THROTTLE
time.sleep(0.4)

set_throttle(0.0)     # NEUTRAL
time.sleep(1.0)
```

**Important Note:** The call to `set_throttle()` is asynchronous; that is, the function returns immediately, very likely _before_ the car's speed actually changes! Furthermore, the call only "lasts" for 1 second, then the car will revert back to a throttle of zero. As a result you must call `set_throttle()` in a loop to keep it active. (This is a safety feature, allowing the car to automatically **STOP** if your program crashes or if the Pi loses communication with the microcontroller.)

### Plot frames in Jupyter

The helper function `car.plot()` will both stream a single frame to your AutoAuto Labs account _and_ it returns a `PIL.Image` object, so you can conveniently use it from Jupyter. See the screenshot below:

![](https://static.autoauto.ai/uploads/abecaaf6d4d34146bd802be839f1f993.png)

### List the device's capabilities

Different MasterAI devices (and different versions of the same device) may have a different set of hardware capabilities. You can ask your device to list its capabilities like this:

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release

my_capabilities = list_caps()

print(my_capabilities)
```

**Note:** In the program above we also imported `acquire` and `release` (although we didn't use them). Those two functions will be used in many of the examples that follow to actually _use_ the capabilites that we listed above.

### Gyroscope

You can get _instantanious_ measurements from the gyroscope like this:

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release
import time

gyroscope = acquire('Gyroscope')

for i in range(100):
    x, y, z = gyroscope.read()
    print(' '.join("{:10.3f}".format(v) for v in (x, y, z)))
    time.sleep(0.05)

release(gyroscope)
```

Or you can get _accumulated_ (or _integrated_, if you prefer) measurements like this (which is likely what you actually want):

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release
import time

gyroscope = acquire('Gyroscope_accum')

for i in range(100):
    x, y, z = gyroscope.read()
    print(' '.join("{:10.3f}".format(v) for v in (x, y, z)))
    time.sleep(0.05)

release(gyroscope)
```

### Accelerometer

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release
import time

accelerometer = acquire('Accelerometer')

for i in range(100):
    x, y, z = accelerometer.read()
    print(' '.join("{:10.3f}".format(v) for v in (x, y, z)))
    time.sleep(0.05)

release(accelerometer)
```

### Buzzer

The `car` package has two helper functions:

```python
import car

car.buzz('!V10 O4 L16 c e g >c8')

car.honk()
```

Or you can use the underlying buzzer interface.

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release

buzzer = acquire("Buzzer")

buzzer.play('!V10 O4 L16 c e g >c8')  # <-- asynchronous call

buzzer.wait()   # <-- block the program until the buzzer finishes playing

release(buzzer)
```

See [Buzzer Language](#buzzer-language) to learn how to write notes as a string that the buzzer can interpret and play.

### Photoresistor

You can use the photoresistor as a very simple ambient light detector.

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release
import time

photoresistor = acquire('Photoresistor')

for i in range(100):
    millivolts, resistance = photoresistor.read()
    print(resistance)
    time.sleep(0.1)

release(photoresistor)
```

The program above prints the resistance of the photoresistor (in Ohms). You can play around with where a good threshold is for your application, and you can quickly see the value change by simply covering the light with your hand or by shining a flashlight at it.

### Push Buttons

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release

buttons = acquire('PushButtons')

print("Press the buttons, and you'll see the events being printed below:")

while True:
    button, action = buttons.wait_for_action('any')
    print("The {}th button was {}.".format(button, action))
    if button == 2:
        break

release(buttons)
```

### Batter voltage

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release

battery = acquire('BatteryVoltageReader')

millivolts = battery.millivolts()
percentage, minutes = battery.estimate_remaining(millivolts)

print('The battery voltage is {} millivolts.'.format(millivolts))
print('It is at ~{}% and will last for ~{} more minutes.'.format(minutes, percentage))

release(battery)
```

**Note:** There's a background task that will monitor the battery voltage for you and will buzz the buzzer when the battery gets to 5% or lower.

### LEDs

The main PCB has three on-board LEDs that you can turn on/off programmatically.

```python
from auto.capabilities import list_caps, acquire, release
import time

buttons = acquire('PushButtons')
leds = acquire('LEDs')

led_ordering = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

print("Press the buttons to turn on/off the on-board LEDs:")

while True:
    button_index, action = buttons.wait_for_action('any')

    # We use the button
    led_identifier = led_ordering[button_index]

    # Turn on the LED when the button is pressed, and off
    # whent he button is released.
    led_value = (action == 'pressed')

    # We set the state of every led below:
    leds.set_led(led_identifier, led_value)

release(buttons)
release(leds)
```

### Calibration

Depending on the device you have, you can run the appropriate calibration script.

| Device Name                     | Calibration Script Name |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| AutoAuto Car with v1 Controller | `calibrate_car_v1`      |

## Buzzer Language

The Buzzer Language<sup>[1](#buzzer-language-copyright)</sup> works as follows:

The notes are specified by the characters C, D, E, F, G, A, and B, and they are played by default as _quarter notes_ with a length of 500 ms. This corresponds to a tempo of 120 beats/min. Other durations can be specified by putting a number immediately after the note. For example, C8 specifies C played as an eighth note (i.e. having half the duration of the default quarter note). The special note R plays a rest (no sound). The sequence parser is case-insensitive and ignores spaces, although spaces are encouraged to help with human readability.

Various control characters alter the sound:

| Control character(s)        | Effect |
| --------------------------- | ------ |
| **A**‚Äì**G**                 | Specifies a note that will be played. |
| **R**                       | Specifies a rest (no sound for the duration of the note). |
| **+** or **#** after a note | Raises the preceding note one half-step. |
| **-** after a note          | Lowers the preceding note one half-step. |
| **1**‚Äì**2000** after a note | Determines the duration of the preceding note. For example, C16 specifies C played as a sixteenth note (1/16th the length of a whole note). |
| **.** after a note          | "Dots" the preceding note, increasing the length by 50%. Each additional dot adds half as much as the previous dot, so that "A.." is 1.75 times the length of "A". |
| **>** before a note         | Plays the following note one octave higher. |
| **<** before a note         | Plays the following note one octave lower. |
| **O** followed by a number  | Sets the octave. (default: O4) |
| **T** followed by a number  | Sets the tempo in beats per minute (BPM). (default: T120) |
| **L** followed by a number  | Sets the default note duration to the type specified by the number: 4 for quarter notes, 8 for eighth notes, 16 for sixteenth notes, etc. (default: L4) |
| **V** followed by a number  | Sets the music volume (0‚Äì15). (default: V15) |
| **MS**                      | Sets all subsequent notes to play play staccato ‚Äì each note is played for 1/2 of its allotted time, followed by an equal period of silence. |
| **ML**                      | Sets all subsequent notes to play legato ‚Äì each note is played for full length. This is the default setting. |
| **!**                       | Resets the octave, tempo, duration, volume, and staccato setting to their default values. These settings persist from one play() to the next, which allows you to more conveniently break up your music into reusable sections. |

Examples:
 - The C-major scale up and back down: "!L16 cdefgab&gt;cbagfedc"
 - The first few measures of Bach's fugue in D-minor: "!T240 L8 agafaea dac+adaea fa&lt;aa&lt;bac#a dac#adaea f4"
