This package contains the interface to AutoAuto v1 microcontroller which we
communicate with via I2C from this host.

"""
In my tests, it seems that the I2C bus will fail ~1/200 times. We can
detect those failures with high probability due to our integrity checks
which we use for all I2C messages, so that's good. Furthermore, we have
a method for automatically retrying failed I2C transactions! In fact, if
we take the 1/200 failure rate as a given, then by retrying up to 5 times
(total, meaning 1 attempt and 4 retries) and assuming independence, we
conclude that we will only see a failure:
    (1/200)**5 = 1/320000000000
Thus, if we do 300 transactions per second, we'll see, on average, one
failure every ~34 years. Someone check my math.
